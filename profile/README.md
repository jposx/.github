# 🍟 JposX

![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,gradle,neovim,github)

Whilst working at McDonald's during my studies as a Software Engineer, I thought to myself:

> *"Huh, the backend service running the restaurant isn't that complicated — surely I could make it myself."*

And that’s where **JposX** started.

It’s a project to **prove**, **practice**, and **develop** my abilities as a software engineer — by building a full-stack, modular point-of-sale system from the ground up.
